API |contract version| updates, October 30, 2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What's new
----------

The Performance flavor class was renamed to align with the OnMetal naming style (Compute,
Memory, and so on). In summary, the following changes have been made to the flavor
classes:

- Two new flavor classes have replaced the Performance flavor classes: **General Purpose
  v1** (like Performance 1 but with combined data and system disk) and **IO v1** (like
  Performance 2).

- Two existing flavors classes (Performance 1 and Performance 2) have been removed from
  the Cloud Control Panel, but they are still visible in the API.

- Two new flavor classes have been added: **Compute v1** and **Memory v1**.

- At a future date, the Standard, Performance 1, and Performance 2 flavor classes will be
  discontinued.
