API |contract version| updates, July 24, 2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What's new
----------

-  OnMetal servers have been introduced. OnMetal extends Rackspace Cloud Servers to support
   single-tenant, bare-metal, high-end hardware specialized to deliver outstanding
   performance for the key workloads typically seen in web applications. These servers can
   be provisioned within minutes via the Cloud Servers API, similar to any other cloud
   instance.

   Significant differences between virtual cloud servers and OnMetal
   cloud servers are as follows:

   -  OnMetal servers are created using special flavors and images.

   -  Private networks are not currently available for OnMetal servers.

   -  OnMetal servers must be created using key pairs, and the admin
      password provided at creation should be neither used nor modified.

   -  Some server actions, like rebuild, resize, rescue, and so on, are
      not applicable to OnMetal servers.

-  The tables of images and flavors have been updated.
