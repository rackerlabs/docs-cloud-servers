API |contract version| updates, June 2, 2015
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What's new
----------

XML examples have been removed. The XML serialization format for API request and
response bodies is no longer supported by OpenStack. To stay consistent with OpenStack
(and industry trends in general), Rackspace has deprecated the use of XML request and
response bodies. New code using the Compute API should not use XML, and current programs
using XML should prepare for the end of XML support. The date when Rackspace will
remove XML support from the Compute API will be announced soon.
