What's new
----------

-  The 256 MB flavor has been removed from the next generation Cloud Servers. While these
   small instances were appropriate in certain cases, they often caused performance
   problems for applications and placed undue stress on underlying host machines. This
   change reduces the number of application performance issues and improves the overall
   Cloud Servers experience.

-  Next generation Cloud Servers now implements a single vCPU allocation scheme across all
   operating systems. Unlike the earlier vCPU allocation scheme, which was optimized for
   burst on Linux and for CPU consistency on Windows, the new scheme favors consistent CPU
   performance while retaining some burst potential. The number of vCPUs is reduced for
   some flavors and increased for others to simplify Cloud Servers while balancing
   predictability and value.

-  OpenStack ready. Rackspace continuously integrates with OpenStack code, which means that
   you have nearly immediate access to product enhancements from the OpenStack community.
