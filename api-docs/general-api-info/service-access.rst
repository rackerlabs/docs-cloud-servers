========================
Service access endpoints
========================

The |apiservice| is a regionalized service. The user of the service is
therefore responsible for selecting the appropriate regional endpoint to ensure
access to servers, networks, or other Cloud services.

.. tip:: To help you decide which regionalized endpoint to use, read about
   :how-to:`special considerations<about-regions>` for choosing a data center.

If you are working with cloud servers that are in one of the Rackspace data
centers, using the ``ServiceNet`` endpoint in the same data center has no
network costs and provides a faster connection. ``ServiceNet`` is the data
center internet network. In your authentication response service catalog, it is
listed as ``InternalURL``.

If you are working with servers that are not in one of the Rackspace data
centers, you must use a public endpoint to connect. In your authentication
response, public endpoints are listed as ``publicURL``. If you are working with
servers in multiple data centers or have a mixed environment where you have
servers in your data centers and in Rackspace data centers, use a public
endpoint because it is accessible from all the servers in the different
environments.

.. tip::
   If you do not know your account ID or which data center you are working in,
   you can find that information in your :mycloud:`Cloud Control Panel<>`.

The following table lists the |product name| endpoints that are available
for each region.

    * - Hong Kong (HKG)
      - ``https://hkg.servers.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2/$TENANT_ID/``

Replace the ``$TENANT_ID`` with your actual account number that is returned as
part of the authentication response. The account number is located  after the
final slash (/) in the ``publicURL`` field.

.. note::

   You should copy the base URLs directly from the catalog rather than trying
   to construct them manually. You can find the complete URI to access the
   Cloud Servers API that includes your account number in the service catalog
   returned in the :ref:`authentication response <review-auth-resp>`. Search the
   catalog for the service name, ``cloudServersOpenStack``. Then copy the URI
   from the *publicURL* field included in the service information.

   Rackspace Cloud Identity returns a service catalog, which includes regional
   endpoints with your account ID. Your account ID, also known as project ID or
   tenant ID, refers to your Rackspace account number.
