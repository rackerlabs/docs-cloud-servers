API extensions
-------------------

Rackspace has implemented several Cloud servers extensions, which provide either new 
functionality or enhanced functionality for existing operations, which are documented in
:rax-devdocs:`Rackspace API Documentation <cloud-servers/v2/developer-guide/#document-extensions>`.
Some extension, however, responds with details inappropriate for the public 
documentation, so it is included here.
