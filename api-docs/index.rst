Rackspace |product name| API |contract version|
===============================================

*Last updated:* |today|

The Rackspace |product name| service
:rax:`powered by OpenStack <cloud/openstack/>` is a fast, reliable, and
scalable cloud compute solution without the risk of proprietary lock-in. It
provides the core features of the OpenStack Compute *API* |contract version|
and also deploys certain extensions as permitted by the OpenStack Compute API
contract. Some of these extensions are generally available through OpenStack
while others implement Rackspace-specific features to meet customers’
expectations and for operational compatibility. The OpenStack Compute API and
the Rackspace extensions are known collectively as the API |contract version|.

This guide is intended to assist software developers who want to develop
applications by using the REST application programming interface (API) for
the |product name| service.

To use the information provided here, you should have a
:rax-cart:`Rackspace Cloud account <cloud>` with access to the Cloud Servers
service. You should also be familiar with the following technologies:

-  Rackspace Cloud Servers service
-  *RESTful* web services
-  *HTTP*/1.1
-  JSON data serialization format
