Listing servers
---------------

To show all the servers in your Cloud account, you can list servers. When you list servers, 
the addresses for any attached networks are displayed. The networks include any isolated 
networks that you have created, as well as the Rackspace public and private networks.

The sections are also organized by example type. To simplify your path through this 
topic, decide whether you prefer neutron-client or cURL examples.

**Next step:** Choose one of the following methods:

-  :ref:`List servers with nova<list-servers-with-nova>`
-  :ref:`List servers with cURL<list-servers-with-curl>`
