========================
Create your first Server
========================

This section walks you through the steps to create an Ubuntu 11.10 server
instance with 8 GBs of physical memory. The simple exercises show you how to
access the API v2 through nova client commands or cURL commands so that you can
quickly create and manage servers. You can also opt to use the supernova client
with the nova client if you use multiple nova environments.

The exercises also help you learn how cURL commands and the API v2 work.

You can modify these examples to create other types and sizes of servers.
