Create your first Server
-------------------------

This section walks you through the steps to create an Ubuntu 11.10 server instance with 8 
GBs of physical memory. The simple exercises show you how to access the API v2 through nova 
client commands or cURL commands so that you can quickly create and manage servers. You can 
also opt to use the supernova client with the nova client if you use multiple nova 
environments.

The exercises also help you learn how cURL commands and the API v2 work.

You can modify these examples to create other types and sizes of servers.
