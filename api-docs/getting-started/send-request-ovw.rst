Sending API requests to |service|
=================================

This section shows how to send requests by using cURL.

.. note::
     You can also use Rackspace Cloud API services by using the following
     methods:

     -  If you are developing applications or automation, try using
        :rax-devdocs:`software development kits <#sdks>`, the
        :rax-devdocs:`Rackspace CLI<rack-cli/>` or
        :os-wiki:`OpenStack client applications <wiki/OpenStackClients>`.

     -  For API development, testing and workflow management in a graphical
        environment, try interacting with the API by using an application such
        as `Postman`_  or `RESTClient for Firefox`_.
