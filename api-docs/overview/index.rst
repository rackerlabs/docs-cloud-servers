About the API
==============

Next generation Cloud Servers :rax:`powered by OpenStack <cloud/openstack/>` is a fast,
reliable, and scalable cloud compute solution without the risk of proprietary lock-in. It 
provides the core features of the OpenStack Compute *API* |contract version| and also 
deploys certain extensions as permitted by the OpenStack Compute API contract. Some of 
these extensions are generally available through OpenStack while others implement 
Rackspace-specific features to meet customersâ€™ expectations and for operational
compatibility. The OpenStack Compute API and the Rackspace extensions are known collectively 
as API |contract version|.


This document describes the features available with API |contract version| and describes 
how to use the following commands and extensions to perform administrative tasks:

-  **Nova or supernova client commands**. Enables you to perform administrative tasks in 
   the |product name| service for customers.

-  **Reset state extension**. Enables you to reset the state of a server instance to an 
   ``ERROR`` or ``ACTIVE`` state. In the ``ERROR`` state, you can delete an instance.

-  **Services extension**. Enables you to get information about and manage currently 
   running services.

A customer might directly request these management operations, however only Rackspace 
support personnel are authorized to perform them.

.. important:: During 2015 and 2016, all First Generation servers will be migrated to
   Next Generation servers, on a rolling basis.

   Notification from Rackspace will be sent to customers informing them of
   their 30-day window to complete the migration of the specified servers.
   If you take no action, your server will be migrated for you.

   To migrate your servers, during your migration window, simply perform a
   ``SOFT`` reboot on your first gen server, either from the Control Panel
   or by using the reboot API operation. The migration process will
   preserve all data and configuration settings.

   During the 30-day migration window, performing a ``HARD`` reboot on a
   first gen server will reboot the server without triggering the
   migration.

   You can see information about your migration window's open and close
   dates, use the Get Server Details on your first gen server, and look in
   the metadata section of the response for
   "FG2NG\_self\_migration\_available\_till" and
   "FG2NG\_self\_migration\_available\_from" key pairs. If your migration
   window has not been scheduled, you will not see these metadata keys.
